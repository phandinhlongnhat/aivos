Hi guys, maybe this is the first time I tried really hard with this project. So, just enjoy the results if it is suitable to what you guys expect, if not you guys can give feedback anytime for me or just download it and fix anything you like.

This project basically can interact with the virtual object in Unity just by your hand without a controller or headset. Do you why this project was born? Actually, because I am from a really poor area in the mountainous area in central Vietnam, I love science and technology a lot but in our area can not easily learn about that, that is the reason why I want to bring XR Technology to the poor area with really low cost.
Now, let's go:
1. I used pycharm to code hand tracking 21-point program, this really normal because it was developed a long time ago, and right now just a story about efficiency, thanks for this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ-2JWzNc6k that inspired me a lot about human-computer interaction, so that was a good step for me to build this project
You guys can use the hand tracking from this video to have a good result about 21-point hand tracking
2. I used pycharm to code a hand gesture program to define what gestures I need to use in the virtual environment, like Picking, Dropping, Pointing, or something else, thanks for this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa2ARoUUdU8&t=1465s that taught me a lot about training data by machine learning, so that I had a good result on what hand gesture I want
3. After all, I designed the virtual hand in Unity and set up some points, and coordinates for a single join of hands, so that I could import the coordinates from different hand gestures belonging to hand tracking what I trained by data that I had after run hand tracking program.
This is a long journey with me and I need to spend around 3 months mapping between hand gesture coordination and virtual hand in Unity. You guys can take a look at the code I pushed on our project.
4. Coding in Unity to interact with virtual objects is a long story too, you guys need to set up some necessary elements on Unity and coding also, so that you guys can interact as smoothly as you can.

So, that is the basics about my project, I am sorry if I explained it not quite clearly because this is the first time I have done something like this, haha so sorry. If you need more information just contact me by GitHub or my social media.
Now, good luck!
